= Channels

TIP: Make sure to read the texts on <<../../../background-information/strong-typedefs.asciidoc#,strong typedefs>>
and <<../../../background-information/midi.asciidoc#,MIDI>> before starting this series of tasks.
`tagged`, `equality` and `ordered` have already been defined for you in `util/tagged.h`.

We start of this series by defining a new type for channels.
MIDI supports up to 16 different channels, so an `uint8_t` will suffice.
Each channel has a unique number `0`-`15` associated with it, but beyond giving us the ability to differentiate between channels (i.e., channel #4 is a different channel than #5), this number has no meaning: channel #0 is not less or more
important than channel #15.
We can swap these channels without it having any effect on the music encoded in them.
In other words, we want `==` and `!=` to be defined on channels, but `<`, `>`, `<=` and `>=` are of no use.

[NOTE,caption="{task-caption}"]
====
Define a new type `Channel` that only supports `==` and `!=`.
Make sure to rely on the types already defined in `util/tagged.h`.
