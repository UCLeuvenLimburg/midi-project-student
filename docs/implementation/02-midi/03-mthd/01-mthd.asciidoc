= `MTHD`

[NOTE,caption={task-caption}]
====
Define a struct `MTHD` that models an <<../../../background-information/midi.asciidoc#mthd,MThd chunk>>.
====

TIP: The compiler will perform some optimizations which you actually don't want. Read up on <<../../../background-information/memory-alignment.asciidoc#,memory alignment>> to counteract these.
