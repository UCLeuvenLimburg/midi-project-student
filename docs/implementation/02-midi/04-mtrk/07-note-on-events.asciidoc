= Note On Events

[NOTE,caption={task-caption}]
====
Add support for note on events to `read_mtrk`.
====

As you may remember from the link:../../../background-information/midi.asciidoc#noteonzerovelocity[MIDI background information], note on events with velocity set to 0 are equivalent to note off events.
`read_mtrk` should **not** implement this rule: this special case is dealt with elsewhere.
Have `read_mtrk` simply call `note_on` whenever a note on event is encountered, regardless of the velocity.
